hashdeep-compare function: part

The real power of hashdeep-compare:
All entries will be partitioned into sets that efficiently describe the
similarities and differences of the two log files.

Syntax:
    hashdeep-compare part \
        path/to/first_log.txt \
        path/to/second_log.txt \
        path/to/output_file_base

Notes:
    The output file base path will be used to name the output files by adding
    suffixes that describe the log entries represented within; it may include
    subdirectories. Nonexistent subdirectories will not be created; if one is
    specified, the command will be aborted.

    Note that if any of the resulting output files already exist, the command
    will be aborted (hashdeep-compare will not overwrite existing files).
