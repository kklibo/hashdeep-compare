Changes a hashdeep log root by removing a prefix from its filepaths.
Any entries with filepaths that do not start with the prefix will be
omitted from the output.

Usage: hashdeep-compare root <path/to/input.txt> <path/to/output.txt> <filepath prefix>

Notes:
    This subcommand is an easy way to recover from a hashdeep run that prepended
    unintended parent directories on all of its filepaths because of its invocation
    directory.

    Warning: The prefix is applied as simple text, without any rules related to paths.
    If the prefix "test" were used on the filepath "testdir/file.txt",
    the resulting filepath would be "dir/file.txt".
    Splitting the text of a path component like this probably isn't what you want,
    but there may be some clever uses for it.

    Note that if the output file already exists, the command will be aborted
    (hashdeep-compare will not overwrite existing files).
